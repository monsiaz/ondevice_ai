OnDeviceAI - Privacy Policy

================================================================================
PRIVACY-FIRST DESIGN COMMITMENT
================================================================================

OnDeviceAI is built with privacy as its foundational principle. We believe your 
conversations, thoughts, and data belong to you and should never leave your 
device without your explicit consent.

================================================================================
1. DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING
================================================================================

1.1 What We DON'T Collect:
• Personal conversations or chat messages
• User prompts or AI responses
• Device identifiers, IP addresses, or location data
• Usage analytics, telemetry, or behavioral tracking
• User accounts, profiles, or authentication data
• Contact lists, photos, or other personal files
• Search history or app usage patterns
• Crash reports or diagnostic data (unless manually shared)

1.2 What We DO Process (On-Device Only):
• Chat conversations stored locally for your convenience
• Model preferences and settings stored in iOS user defaults
• Downloaded AI models stored in your app's sandboxed directory
• Performance metrics for optimization (never transmitted)

1.3 On-Device Processing:
All artificial intelligence processing occurs entirely on your device using:
• Local neural network computation via MLX framework
• iOS system frameworks for UI and data management
• No external API calls for AI inference or model execution
• Complete offline functionality for core features

================================================================================
2. DATA STORAGE AND RETENTION
================================================================================

2.1 Local Storage:
• Conversations: Stored in iOS app sandbox using UserDefaults and local files
• Models: Downloaded to secure app directory with iOS file system encryption
• Settings: Stored locally using iOS standard UserDefaults mechanism
• History: Maintained locally with user-controlled deletion options

2.2 Data Retention:
• You control all data retention through in-app settings
• Conversations can be deleted individually or en masse
• Downloaded models can be removed to free storage space
• All data is automatically deleted when you uninstall the app

2.3 Data Security:
• All local data benefits from iOS encryption and sandboxing
• No data synchronization with cloud services
• No backup of conversations to iCloud or other cloud platforms
• Models are downloaded over HTTPS and verified for integrity

================================================================================
3. NETWORK USAGE AND EXTERNAL CONNECTIONS
================================================================================

3.1 Model Downloads:
• AI models are downloaded from reputable sources (Hugging Face, etc.)
• Downloads occur only with your explicit permission
• HTTPS encryption protects download integrity
• No personal data is transmitted during model downloads

3.2 No Analytics or Tracking:
• No connection to analytics services (Google Analytics, Firebase, etc.)
• No advertising networks or tracking SDKs
• No social media integrations or sharing capabilities
• No error reporting to external services without explicit user action

3.3 Future Updates:
• App updates occur through the iOS App Store standard mechanism
• No automatic data transmission with app updates
• Update process does not access or transmit user data

================================================================================
4. THIRD-PARTY AI MODELS
================================================================================

4.1 Model Sources:
• AI models are sourced from public repositories and creators
• Each model retains its original license and terms
• Models process data locally without external communication
• No data is transmitted to model creators or hosting platforms

4.2 Model Privacy:
• Downloaded models operate entirely offline
• No telemetry or usage data is sent to model developers
• Models cannot access data outside the OnDeviceAI application
• You can delete any model at any time

================================================================================
5. PERMISSIONS AND ACCESS
================================================================================

OnDeviceAI requests minimal iOS permissions:
• Storage: To download and store AI models locally
• Network: Only for downloading models (optional)
• No camera, microphone, contacts, or location access required
• No background app refresh or notifications

================================================================================
6. CHILDREN'S PRIVACY
================================================================================

While OnDeviceAI does not collect personal information from any users, we are 
committed to protecting children's privacy:
• No personal data collection means COPPA compliance by design
• Parental controls can be implemented through iOS Screen Time
• No social features or communication with other users
• Content filtering relies on model training and user supervision

================================================================================
7. INTERNATIONAL USERS
================================================================================

7.1 GDPR Compliance (EU):
• No personal data processing means automatic GDPR compliance
• Right to erasure: Delete app to remove all data
• Data portability: Export conversations locally if needed
• No data processing consent required due to local-only processing

7.2 CCPA Compliance (California):
• No personal information collection, sale, or sharing
